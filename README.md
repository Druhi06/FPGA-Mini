**Description**: Understanding the Verilog Code  

Step 1: What the Verilog Code Does

Overview

The Verilog file top.v is a simple program that makes an RGB LED light up in different colors. It does this by using a clock signal inside the FPGA to control when the light changes.
What‚Äôs Inside?

‚Ä¢	Inputs:
  o	hw_clk: This is the hardware clock input. It comes from an onboard oscillator (SB_HFOSC) that keeps everything running at a steady pace, like a heartbeat.

‚Ä¢	Outputs:
  o	led_red, led_blue, led_green: These are the three-color channels of the RGB LED. The FPGA controls these signals to change the LED‚Äôs color.
  o	testwire: This is a test signal, usually used for debugging or checking if the FPGA is running properly.

How It Works
‚Ä¢	Oscillator (SB_HFOSC): Generates a clock signal that controls the timing of the LED blinks.
‚Ä¢	Counter Logic: Uses the clock signal to determine when to switch LED colors.
‚Ä¢	RGB LED Driver: Manages the brightness and color of the LED by turning the red, blue, and green signals on or off.

Summary
Basically, the FPGA takes a clock signal, processes it, and then makes the RGB LED blink in a specific pattern.

Step 2: Understanding the PCF File

The VSDSquadronFM.pcf file tells the FPGA which physical pins to use.

Pin Assignments

Signal	Pin	Description
led_red	39	Controls the red part of the RGB LED.
led_blue	40	Controls the blue part of the RGB LED.
led_green	41	Controls the green part of the RGB LED.
hw_clk	20	The main clock input for timing.
testwire	17	A test signal used for debugging.

These numbers match the physical pins on the FPGA board where each component is connected.

Step 3: Hooking Up the FPGA Mini Board

What‚Äôs on the Board?
‚Ä¢	FPGA Chip: The main brain of the board.
‚Ä¢	USB-to-SPI Communication: Helps the computer talk to the FPGA.
‚Ä¢	32 GPIO Pins: These are extra pins you can use to connect stuff.
‚Ä¢	4MB Flash Storage: Stores the FPGA‚Äôs program.
‚Ä¢	RGB LED: Blinks different colors!

Setting It Up
1.	Plug the board into your computer with a USB-C cable.
2.	Open a terminal and type:

lsusb
If everything is working, you should see Future Technology Devices International in the list.

Uploading the Code
1.	Clear old files:
make clean
2.	Compile the program:
make build
3.	Send it to the FPGA:
sudo make flash
4.	Look at the RGB LED‚Äîit should be blinking!

Step 4: Wrapping Up

What We Learned
‚Ä¢	The Verilog code controls the RGB LED with a clock.
‚Ä¢	The PCF file tells the FPGA which pins to use.
‚Ä¢	We successfully programmed the FPGA and made the LED blink.

Troubleshooting

Problem	Solution

Board not recognized	Unplug and plug it back in, then run lsusb
Flashing failed	Try sudo make flash again

What‚Äôs Next?
‚Ä¢	Try changing the LED blink pattern.
‚Ä¢	Add a button to change the LED color when pressed.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Task 3

<summary>Click to expand Task 3 description</summary>

**Description**: UART Transmitter Module  

This module is all about getting a basic UART transmitter up and running. It uses the 8N1 format, which stands for:
‚Ä¢	8 data bits
‚Ä¢	No parity bit
‚Ä¢	1 stop bit

It sends serial data at 9600 baud, with the timing derived from a 12 MHz oscillator. The module runs on a simple state machine and includes some bonus visuals‚Äîlike blinking RGB LEDs‚Äîto make sure you can tell it‚Äôs doing something!

1. Understanding the Code

Top Module: The Brain of the Operation
The top module pulls together several components:
‚Ä¢	A 12 MHz internal clock
‚Ä¢	A clock divider to generate a 9600 Hz signal
‚Ä¢	The UART transmission logic
‚Ä¢	A small RGB LED control system

Here‚Äôs how each part plays its role:
‚Ä¢	Clock Generation: It starts with an internal 12 MHz oscillator.
‚Ä¢	Clock Division: That frequency is divided by 1250. Since UART clocks need to toggle every half-period, the actual toggle happens every 625 cycles. This results in a clean 9600 Hz clock, which matches our baud rate.
‚Ä¢	UART Transmission: The transmitter keeps sending the character 'D' over and over using the 8N1 format.
‚Ä¢	LED Blinking: The RGB LEDs are connected to a counter. Different bits of this counter toggle the LEDs, so they blink at regular intervals, giving you a visual confirmation that the system is active.

In short, this module handles timing, transmits a test character, and blinks LEDs‚Äîall in sync.
uart_tx_8n1 Module: How Data is Sent
The actual transmission logic lives in the uart_tx_8n1 module. It uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) to go through the steps of sending each bit of the UART frame.
Baud Rate Generator: Getting to 9600 Baud

Here‚Äôs how it creates the correct timing signal:
‚Ä¢	A counter increases with every tick of the 12 MHz clock.
‚Ä¢	When it hits 1249, it resets and toggles a signal called baudclk_en.
‚Ä¢	Since this toggle happens every 1250 cycles, it results in a 9600 Hz signal, which matches the required UART baud rate.

State Machine Breakdown: Step-by-Step Transmission

The FSM moves through different states to send a full UART frame:

1. IDLE (STATE_IDLE)
‚Ä¢	When senddata = 1:
  o	The module moves to STATE_STARTTX
  o	The byte to be sent (txbyte) is loaded into a buffer called buf_tx
  o	txdone is cleared, meaning transmission is now in progress
‚Ä¢	If senddata = 0, it stays idle:
  o	txbit stays high (UART line idles high)
  o	txdone stays low

2. START BIT (STATE_STARTTX)
‚Ä¢	txbit is set to 0 to indicate the start of transmission
‚Ä¢	The system then moves to STATE_TXING

3. SENDING DATA (STATE_TXING)
‚Ä¢	As long as bits_sent < 8:
  o	The least significant bit (LSB) of buf_tx is sent out through txbit
  o	buf_tx is shifted right to prepare the next bit
  o	bits_sent is increased by 1

4. STOP BIT (STATE_TXDONE)
‚Ä¢	After all 8 data bits are sent:
  o	txbit is set to 1 (stop bit)
  o	bits_sent is reset
  o	State changes to STATE_TXDONE

5. DONE ‚Üí BACK TO IDLE
‚Ä¢	In STATE_TXDONE, the system:
  o	Sets txdone = 1 to indicate the frame is fully transmitted
  o	Moves back to STATE_IDLE, ready for the next byte

This shows how the components are connected physically‚Äîgreat for when you're wiring it up on your FPGA board.

3. Synthesis & Programming

Once the code is ready, here‚Äôs how to test everything:

Step 1: Clone the Repo
bash
CopyEdit
git clone 

Step 2: Build the Bitstream
bash
CopyEdit
make build

This command compiles the project and creates top.bin, which you‚Äôll load onto your FPGA.

Step 3: Flash It to the FPGA
bash
CopyEdit
sudo make flash

This uploads the design onto your FPGA board.

Step 4: Open the UART Terminal
bash
CopyEdit
sudo make terminal
Once this runs, you should see the letter 'D' appearing repeatedly. That‚Äôs your UART transmission in action‚Äîsending data at 9600 baud, just as expected.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Task 4

**Description**: Implementing a UART Transmitter Based on Sensor Inputs

Objective

The aim of this project is to build a system that can send sensor data from an FPGA to another device (like a computer or microcontroller) using UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication. This allows real-time sensor values to be monitored externally, making it ideal for applications where live data tracking is essential.

1. Understanding the Code and How It Works

What Does the Module Do?

The main module here is called sense_uart_tx. It takes in sensor readings and sends them out as serial data over UART. It‚Äôs structured into four main parts:
‚Ä¢	Reading and preparing sensor data
‚Ä¢	Generating a 9600 baud UART clock
‚Ä¢	Handling UART data transmission
‚Ä¢	Using a state machine to manage the process

Step-by-Step Operation

Sensor Data Sampling
‚Ä¢	The FPGA reads 32-bit sensor data at regular intervals.
‚Ä¢	When new data is ready, a signal called data_valid goes high.
‚Ä¢	This triggers the transmission process, and the sensor value is loaded into a buffer.

Generating the UART Clock
‚Ä¢	To match standard UART speed, we need a 9600 baud clock.
‚Ä¢	This is done using a counter-based clock divider, which creates accurate timing for each bit being sent.

Sending the Data Over UART

Here‚Äôs how the UART frame is structured and sent:
‚Ä¢	Start Bit: A logic 0 marks the beginning of transmission.
‚Ä¢	Data Bits: The sensor value is sent in 8-bit chunks (1 byte at a time).
‚Ä¢	Stop Bit: A logic 1 indicates the end of the frame.
‚Ä¢	A state machine controls this process, moving from one step to the next in sync with the baud clock.

Status Signals
‚Ä¢	tx_done: Goes high when the current transmission is finished.
‚Ä¢	ready: Lets the system know it‚Äôs ready to send the next data point‚Äîthis prevents data from getting lost if new sensor readings come in too quickly.

2. Breaking Down the Ports

System Signals
‚Ä¢	clk: Main clock input that drives the system.
‚Ä¢	reset_n: Resets the system (active-low).

Sensor Inputs
‚Ä¢	sensor_data [31:0]: The actual sensor readings that need to be transmitted.
‚Ä¢	data_valid: Tells the module when new data is available.

UART Output
‚Ä¢	tx_out: The UART data line, connected to the device receiving the sensor values.

Control Signals
‚Ä¢	tx_start: Starts the UART transmission.
‚Ä¢	tx_done: Goes high when the data has been fully sent.
‚Ä¢	ready: Indicates the system is idle and ready for the next transmission.

3. Internal Logic

How the State Machine Works

The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) to handle different stages of data transmission:
1.	IDLE: Waits for data_valid to go high.
2.	START: Sends the start bit (0).
3.	DATA: Sends the data, 8 bits at a time.
4.	STOP: Sends the stop bit (1).
5.	DONE: Signals tx_done and returns to IDLE.

Baud Rate Generator
‚Ä¢	This part of the module divides down the main clock to generate a 9600 Hz UART clock‚Äîperfectly timed for reliable data transmission.

Shift Register
‚Ä¢	The 32-bit sensor data is stored in a register.
‚Ä¢	During each UART frame, 8 bits are shifted out and sent until the whole 32-bit value is transmitted.

4. System Architecture

FPGA buffers and prepares it for UART.
TX Shift Register formats the data.
UART TX Logic transmits it serially.

5. Synthesis & Programming

Here‚Äôs how to build and test the design on your FPGA:

Step 1: Clone the Project Repository
bash
CopyEdit
git clone 

Step 2: Build the Bitstream
bash
CopyEdit

This will compile the code and create top.bin‚Äîthe bitstream file you‚Äôll upload to your FPGA.

Step 3: Flash the Bitstream to the FPGA
bash
CopyEdit
sudo make flash

This uploads your design to the FPGA board.

Step 4: Test the UART Output
bash
CopyEdit
sudo make terminal

Once the terminal opens, you should see sensor data being printed‚Äîthis confirms the UART transmission is working properly at 9600 baud.
